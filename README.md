Repository created for Bootcamp Homework due 08232020

created and cloned respository for the python_challenge homework package

I can revisit this homework to troubleshoot more as I am very dissappointed in it at this point.
    I was able to complete most all of the work, but very close to the final calculations I did something I cannot debug.

    I did multiple git pushes to GitHub, so I tried to recover the last code that worked, but it didn't run as before.
    I rebooted, tried to comment out portions to get to atleast complete the run again.
    I believe I have an issue with the 2nd set of calculations for percentage on the candidates voting.

I unfortunately spent a LOT of my time trying to figure out how to loop through the names on PyPoll.

I feel as though I grasp the concepts, short of a a couple of things I can mimick, but do not understand.
